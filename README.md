# Office365-Endpoint-Management-Samples
Sample Scripts using the O365 Rest API or the Get-PacFile Module for Whitelisting and Managing O365 Connections

All the scripts in the collection leverage either the Official O365 Rest API or the Get-PacFile script which can be installed by running:
```
Install-Script -Name Get-PacFile 
```

The purpose of the repo is to provide an example of how those two resources can be leveraged for automated O365 Endpoint Managing, Whitelisting and Change Tracking.
